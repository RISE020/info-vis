## Reflection

TODO: Describe how the feedback from your TA and/or your peers helps you improve
your data story. Also, describe self-reflections (if any) using the design
guidelines about how to evaluate visualizations that we taught in the lectures.

On Tuesday, June 25th, a peer review session was held with fellow students and a TA. During the presentation of our data story, we explained our project from start to finish.

We did this in a structured manner, explaining why we made certain choices. The core of this assignment is, of course, about telling a story using data. Visualizations and interactions are crucial in this regard. The group found our charts and interactions very useful and clear, with one exception. This exception concerned the bubble chart for particulate matter emissions. The feedback we received was that it was hard to read, and we might clarify it using specific colors. For example, green for low values of particulate matter and red for high values.

We also received feedback on the perspectives used in our data story and how we should further develop the second perspective. The TA mentioned that these could be indicated with headings.

In the presentation, we deliberately withheld the heatmap because we found it too unclear for the data story after mutual discussion. This will be adjusted so that the data can be more easily interpreted by a potential reader.

In our opinion, the feedback received is very beneficial and helped us to continue working in the right direction. We already had internal discussions on some topics, but new insights also emerged on how to make the data story even more complete and clearer. For example, we could establish connections between low emissions in 2020 and the outbreak of the coronavirus.

Looking back on the project, we have learned a lot about visualizing information. The data we visualized provides a clear picture of how much emissions are associated with a variable number of flights, passengers, etc. This new information can be used to keep emissions as low as possible and reduce unnecessary emissions as much as possible. Whether Schiphol will take our findings into account, however, is another matter.
