## Work Distribution

TODO: Explain the distribution of work among the team members (i.e., describing who
is responsible for what)

### Casper Sikkema
Joshua and I selected the subject and created the proposal. I also cleaned the datasets used for this project. Following that, I primarily coordinated the project, ensuring everyone knew their tasks. Additionally, I contributed by creating the graphs and compiling everything to publish on GitHub Pages.

### Joshua Appiah
Casper and I selected the subject and created the proposal. I helped by searching and finding datasets. I made sure to work out the perspectives and arguments. Additionally, I helped Mohamed and Mees with the data story where needed. 


### Mohamed Khalifa
I primarily focused on developing the data story. My goal was to create a complete narrative. I achieved this by writing and editing texts to ensure a smooth flow, making it a unified story. Additionally, I provided explanations for all the charts, which makes the data story easier to read.

### Mees Dorman
Due to certain circumstances, I joined the group a bit later and had some catching up to do. I wrote the reflection and supported my group where needed. Additionally, I helped Mohamed with drafting the data story, ensuring it was as clear as possible for future readers.
