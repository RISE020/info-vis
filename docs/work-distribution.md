## Work Distribution
For this project, our main forms of communication were during lectures and through Canvas. Although we began this project with only two members, we completed it with four, ensuring that everyone made an equal contribution to the final deliverable.

### Casper Sikkema
Joshua and I selected the subject and created the proposal. I also cleaned the datasets used for this project. Following that, I primarily coordinated the project, ensuring everyone knew their tasks. Additionally, I contributed by creating the graphs and compiling everything to publish on GitHub Pages.

### Joshua Appiah
Casper and I selected the subject and created the proposal. I contributed by searching for and finding relevant datasets. I also developed the perspectives and arguments. Additionally, I assisted Mohamed and Mees with the data story as needed.

### Mohamed Khalifa
I primarily focused on developing the data story. My goal was to create a complete narrative. I achieved this by writing and editing texts to ensure a smooth flow, making it a unified story. Additionally, I provided explanations for all the charts, which makes the data story easier to read.

### Mees Dorman
Due to certain circumstances, I joined the group a bit later and had some catching up to do. I wrote the reflection and supported my group where needed. Additionally, I helped Mohamed with drafting the data story, ensuring it was as clear as possible for future readers.
